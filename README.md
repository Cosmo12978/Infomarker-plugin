This is an infomarker system where you can place environment text markers for players that are given the flag.

Flag Needed to spawn a marker: M
Command to Spawn /Infomarker  ( the only player that can edit a marker is the player that spawned it using this command )
A nice UI is featured on the base of the marker ( use context menu to find it easy )
